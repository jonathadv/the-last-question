# The Last Question Countdown

This is a homage to the Isaac Asimov's short story [*The Last Question*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Question).

How long until The Last Question is asked for the first time? This countdown answers it. 

> "The last question was asked for the first time, half in jest, on May 21, 2061, at a time when humanity first stepped in to the light."
